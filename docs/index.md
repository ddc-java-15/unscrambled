## Summary

This game takes a complete image and breaks it down into various numbers of images which it then
scrambles in a random order. The split image is placed into a frame with a single open spot, forcing
the user to re-order them correctly by sliding them around inside the framework in order to advance.
Advanced settings can be enabled that cause individual tiles to be randomly rotated as well as
breaking up the order in which they are placed.

## Intended users

* Completionist mindset persons who have spare time to game.

  > As a detail oriented person who has a great deal of downtime whilst on the clock due to
  > the nature of my job, I need a game that allows me to indulge those tendencies. Playing this
  > game allows me to focus on completing the relatively simple but highly involved task of
  > completing an image and makes my day pass by much more quickly than it otherwise might.

* Individuals with children who need a short game to entertain their children for a short period,
  such as waiting in line in public.

  > As a stay at home parent, I take my children out with me while running errands, it helps to have
  > a simple game on my mobile device to hand them and keep them quiet until I have finished with my
  > business. My children are not only entertained, and thus not underfoot, but are given a sense
  > of accomplishment by completing the game's goals and unlocking different images for their
  > device's background.
